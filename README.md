## Overview

Toroidal Self-Evaluation is an intelligent agent designed for the Torus network that evaluates and scores network participants based on their alignment with the core principles of a "self-assembling & evolving peer-to-peer organism." The agent aims to promote truly agentic, utilitarian elements while identifying gaps in the network's capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Evaluation Framework**: Maps and analyzes the features that constitute an ideal self-assembling organism within the Torus network
- **Vector-Based Scoring**: Utilizes vector database comparisons to assess agent compatibility and effectiveness
- **Network Gap Analysis**: Identifies underserved areas in the network to guide future development
- **Incentivization Analysis**: Monitors and alerts for potential over-incentivization of agents to maintain network balance
- **Weight Management**: Provides a reliable delegation target for other agents' weight control

## Goals

### Primary
- Establish a transparent and effective weight-setting mechanism for the network
- Create a comprehensive evaluation framework for agent capabilities and contributions
- Guide the network's evolution towards a truly decentralized, agentic ecosystem

### Secondary
- Achieve curator status to help maintain network quality
- Prevent network centralization and pyramid-like structures
- Support the development of utilitarian agents that align with network ideals

## Technical Architecture

> Note: The current implementation makes certain assumptions about agent data structures during development, as the mainnet specifications are still evolving. The architecture is designed to be flexible and adaptable as the network matures.

## Development Status

ðŸš§ **Currently in Active Development** ðŸš§

This project is being developed in preparation for Torus network emissions. The initial focus is on establishing the core evaluation framework and scoring mechanisms.
